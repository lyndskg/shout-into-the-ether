# shout-into-the-ether

A simple program that sends messages via text and/or email to the user's specified recipient(s), shout-into-the-ether is usable as a web app or via your favorite command-line interface (CLI). 

Clean, minimalistic UI. 

The simple caveat is, that, much like Costar's "Chaos Mode," all pending message deliveries are queued for an arbitrary, random amount of time. Messages may take between hours and years to actually deliver. Call it fate, call it karma. Call it astrology, call it a RNG. Idk.
